# X-Wing Computer
Contains the files for my on-board computer for the 2019 Halloween, where I'm building a to-scale, working X-Wing.

Audio Files are provided for this project ONLY! And are not covered under my project liscence. All rights for those files belong to their appropriate owners (most likely Lucasfilm Ltd).

If the audio files end up being a problem, I will instead provide instructions on how to obtain them yourself. Please note, this program will only run with 16-Bit Wav files! Many of these file started as mp3 files - you can not simply convert them to .wav, you must first convert them to 16-bit, then to .wav!
